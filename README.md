# 'ongenome' Schema

Repository to describe and create the schema, and develope loader scripts. 

#### About

This repository 'ongenome_schema' is about a non-Chado schema to house RNASeq gene expression data for LIS.  It started with designing the schema for counts data after mapping to a reference genome.  The scheme can be extended, when needed, to accommodate other counts data such as ChIPSeq data, etc. This would need creating additional tables in addition to the ones now exist for accommodating expression data.  

'ongenome': Values/counts data resulting from mapping ON to a reference GENOME.
